This program is to simulate collisions of particles in a two-dimensional box. 
Particles can collide with the walls and with each other. 
Also, it uses an event-driven approach by calculating the times of all possible interactions and allowing the earliest collision to occur. 
The event-driven approach can offer more accuracy by computing exact collision times as well as more efficiency by waiting until a collision happens to update a particleâ€™s position.


Run:
./particles [filesname] [end time]
